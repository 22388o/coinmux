v0.1 - Functional Prototype
* Creates transactions with no bad actors present
* Works for testnet usage
* May have single point of failure (i.e. blockchain HTTP API)
* May have external application dependencies (i.e. Freenet)

v0.2 - Functional Beta
* Creates transactions with no bad actors present
* Works for Mainnet usage for advanced users
* Remove single points of failure
* Support WIF private keys
* Transaction fee calculation use transaction size info.
* Support multiple input addresses during CoinJoin (proper fee calculation required)

v0.3 - Improve deterrence of bad actors
* Ensure that all participants are active (signature of current Director status?)
* Add proof of work for posting inputs / creating new CoinJoin (?)
* Require minimum confirmations for input address (?)
* Blacklist of "bad addresses" (probably not workable)
* Encrypt all messages after publish of message_verification so only participants and director can decrypt
* Can specify/create custom CoinJoin URI
* Dependent Gems are part of project

v1.0 - Stable enough and feature rich enough for novice users
* Installers for OSX, Windows, Linux
* Improved UI/UX
* User can use proxy server (i.e Tor)
* Existing wallets can integrate CoinJoin protocol when sending transactions

FUTURE FEATURES:

* Fund by creating a new address and starting coin_join once funds confirmed (instead of/in addition to specifying private key)
* Embed Freenet (or move to P2P [TomP2P] or Bitmessage)
* Automatic retries of failed transactions
* Acts as anonymous wallet (mix to new address, the send)
* Allow single transaction input with value equal to CoinJoin amount to pay 0 transaction fee for rejoining
% Use stealth address for output address / change
